# Ultimaker Material Tag Editor

In the CURA file structure there are several “material.xml” files, which are linked to a particular material via a GUID. 

This functionality is used to point to materials based on a provided identifier from an NFC tag which is attached to a material reel.

A reel “PLA-Transparent” has a GUID of “532e8b3d-5fd4-4149-b936-53ada9bd6b85” which points to a material of the same GUID within the printer.

The aim of this project was to change the identifier in a way so that a tag can point to other materials.
